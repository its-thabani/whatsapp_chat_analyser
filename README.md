# whatsapp_chat_analyser

This is a simple script to analyse interaction between 2 people who are romantically involved.

(Words can be changed to make the analysis suit another form of relationship.)

Stats obtained from this can be used as input into a spreadsheet software to create interesting chats such as knowing when one person messages more or what day of the week they say the most loving things. The longer the chat history, the better the data.

### usage

- export your whatsapp chat and copy the text file into the same directory as the script
- change the config section of the script (first set of comments) and alter `name1`, `name2` & `chat_location` to match the names of people in the chat to match the export as well as putting in the name of the chat export file
- install python if you don't already have it and run the script
